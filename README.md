# ML_Project_1
Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have been given detailed consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If we are able to predict this, consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are handled as well as how persuasively the final conclusions are conveyed to them.

This project is created using Python and Machine learning libraries.
